History
-------

I created CrowdCourse in the summer of 2012 as an entrepreneurial venture. After building the site
completely, I continuted to add features over a period of about 6 months. During that time I
personally created many videos and added them to the catalogue. I was able to attract a small number
of other passionate contributors. Eventually, I came to realize that the traction was not what I had
hoped for. Furthermore, there was no clear way from profiting from running the site, at least not
anyway that was consistent with my belief that education should be free and easily accessible. For
these reasons I sold the domain in 2013 and the site is no longer online.

How it Works
------------

CrowdCourse is built around the idea that anyone can teach. Courses on CrowdCourse consist of
a series of short videos and corresponding interactive quizzes. Once a course has been created,
anyone in the community can contribute videos which attempt to explain a given topic in a better
way. Each video is rated, and the ones which are rated the highest will rise to the top.


Technology
----------

CrowdCourse is built on top of Ruby on Rails version 3.2. It is intended to be deployed to heroku.
It uses PostgreSQL as a database. The frontend stack consists of Rails templates and some custom
javascript written using only jQuery.
