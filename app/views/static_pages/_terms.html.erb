	our Terms of Service) infringes one or more of your copyrights, please notify us by providing a
	written notice (“Infringement Notice”) containing the information described below to the designated
	agent listed below. If CrowdCourse takes action in response to an Infringement Notice, it will make a
	good faith attempt to contact the party that made such content available by means of the most recent
	email address, if any, provided by such party to CrowdCourse.

			An identification of the copyright claimed to have been infringed;
		</li>
		<li>
			A description of the nature and exact location of the content that you claim to infringe your 
			copyright, in sufficient detail to permit CrowdCourse to find and positively identify that content; 
			for example we require a link to the specific video (not just the name of the video).
		</li>
		<li>
			Your name, address, telephone number and email address; and
		</li>
		<li>
			A statement by you: (a) that you believe 
			in good faith that the use of the content that you claim to infringe your copyright is not

			contained in your Infringement Notice is accurate, and (c) under penalty of perjury, that you are

	infringe copyrights and asking for access to be reinstated. Counter-Notices need to be sent to our
	designated agent set forth above and must include the following:

	Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature; A statement that you consent
	to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are
	located (or if you are outside the U.S., the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District
	of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided
	us with the Infringement Notice (the “Copyright Holder”); Identification of the allegedly infringing
	content and its location before removal or disabling of access; and A statement under penalty of
	perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification.
